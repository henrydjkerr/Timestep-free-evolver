### Program overview

The core program file is `evolver.py`.  This is stored at the top level of the file structure, along with the config file `settings_selection.txt`, which is used to select more detailed config files from the config folder.  These subsidiary config files 

The folder `config` stores `.txt` files that determine the parameters and arrays of the model, which modules to use to implement the model, and optional importing of initial conditions from file.  `settings_selection.txt` is contained in the same folder as `evolver.py`, and determines which files from `config` are read.  Once a model is set up, day-to-day use of the program should only require editing of the config files and the possible generation of initial conditions through auxilliary programs in the side-tools folder.

The program interprets any line in a config file that contains a `:` as specifying a key:value pair and adds them to a corresponding dictionary.  The program will attempt to interpret the value as an integer, then as a float, then as a string.  Lines without a `:` are ignored, but I've sometimes used the `|` character as a stylistic comment marker anyway. 

`settings_selection.txt` contains four options:
 - `parameters` specifies config file for the numerical values for various parameters used by the program, including model parameters and numerical tolerances.
 - `modules` specifies the config file for the customisable modules loaded by the program to construct the full model.  Some modules are mandatory and not specified in this file; these are contained in the folder "modules/general".
 - `arrays` specifies the config file for the arrays to be generated by the program.  These are specified in a key:length:data-type triplet, rather than the usual key:value pair.
 - `import` specifies the config file for which arrays should be initialised with values from which files (located in the top-level directory, along with `evolver.py`).  Arrays not mentioned are instead initialised algorithmically through modules.
